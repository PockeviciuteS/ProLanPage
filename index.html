        <h1>Where do wolves live?</h1>
        <p>The wolf was once widespread throughout Europe. However, in large parts of its original range, particularly in Western and Central Europe, the species was eradicated by humans. Thanks to intensified conservation efforts as well as a hunting ban, populations in some European countries have been recovering for a number of years - for example, in Italy, Poland and Croatia. Since the end of the 1990s, the wolf has also become re-established in Germany. Initially originating in the East, the wolf has now become indigenous in almost all of Germany's federal states.
            Wolves are very adaptable animals and they are found in the most diverse of regions and habitats. Most wolves live in forests because, for centuries, they were persecuted and pushed back into less accessible areas. In order for wolves to become established in a region, they need an adequate supply of water and prey as well as quiet places where they can rear their young.</p>

            <h1>Wolf characteristics</h1>
            <p>Wolves are the ancestors of our domestic dogs. In some breeds, such as sheepdogs or huskies, the similarities are clear to see. In contrast to wolf-like domestic dogs, wolves have a longer body as well as being longer in the leg. Wolves can attain a body length of 100 to 150 centimetres, a shoulder height of 60 to 90 centimetres and a weight of 30 to 70 kilos, although females are generally smaller and lighter than their male counterparts. Wolves’ markings are quite varied. In temperate regions of Europe, their fur is predominantly dark grey to brown in colour. An adult wolf’s typical paw print is 8 to 10 centimetres long. The animal’s claws are clearly visible, and this enables the tracks of a wolf to be distinguished from those of a lynx, for example. Unlike felines, wolves cannot retract their claws.

                Wolves can live to a similar age as dogs - around 10 to 12 years. Premature death in wolves can occur for a number of different reasons. In addition to the diseases that also inflict dogs, such as distemper or rabies, road traffic in particular is a life-threatening hazard for wolves.</p>
